# Calculator Web Application

## This is an application that works with the basic functions of a calculator

### This project serves as a "practice run" on learning how to create my own projects and a way to test my web development skills as a self-taught junior web developer.
### The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features of the application:
- Clear (AC) button
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division function/button
- Responsive layout

### The application can be ran on a web browser by:
1. Clone the respository:

2. Open 'index.html' in your browser
