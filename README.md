# Calculator Web Application

## This is an application that works with the basic functions of a calculator

### This project serves as a "practice run" on learning how to create my own projects and a way to test my web development skills as a self-taught junior web developer.
### The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features of the application:
- Clear (AC) button
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division function/button
- Responsive layout

## The application can be ran on a web browser by:
1. Clone the respository:
   - https://github.com/STARBOYJEDI/Calculator-App-2
2. Open 'index.html' in your browser

## The application is simple to use and uses the basic functions of a standard calculator.
- Click the number buttons to enter values
- Select an operator (+, -, x, ÷)
- Press '=' to calculate the result
- Press 'AC' to reset the calculator

## What I learned from this personal project.
- Handling User Input in JavaScript
- Relevant styling techniques in CSS
- Error Handling
